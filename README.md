# CodeAlpha_HangmanGame
simple text-based Hangman game for the CodeAlpha Python Internship
# CodeAlpha Internship â€“ Hangman Game

This project is part of my **Python Internship at CodeAlpha**.  
The task was to build a **simple text-based Hangman game** where the player guesses a word one letter at a time.

#Project Goal
Create a console-based Hangman game using Python, following these requirements:
- Use a small list of 5 predefined words.
- Limit incorrect guesses to 6.
- Use basic console input/output (no graphics).
- Apply core Python concepts.

# Key Concepts Used
- `random`
- `while loop`
- `if-else`
- `strings`
- `lists`
